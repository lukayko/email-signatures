# Email signatures

List of email signatures I created. These signatures can be used in email providers and will work.

## How to see the signatures?

Just download the html file and run it locally in your browser. The signature should display. You can also input it into email service provider to see it in action.
**To test it in Gmail follow these steps:**

1. Open Gmail in your browser.
2. In the upper right hand corner click on settings.
3. Click on "See all settings".
4. Scroll down until you see signature.
5. Open the HTML file in your browser and then CTRL + A, CTRL + C.
6. Input it in the Gmail.
7. Test it in an email. Make sure to **not** use plain text.

## Information about signatures

I intentionally removed the image and updated the contact information to preempt any potential issues for my client. Nonetheless, the overall layout remains unchanged.
